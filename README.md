# Weather

Prepare for your day with the most accurate hourly, and 7-day forecasts. Stunning Unsplash photos match your location, time of day, and current conditions.
The UI of the app was obtained from the YahooWeather.
In this app i use OpenMeteo API to get weather data and Unsplash API to load photos. 

Version 1.0, 12.03.2024: This is the current version with basic functionality in which the users can get data for their current location or search for any places they want and save it to database to retrieve weather information later.

With new functionality i will be updating the readme.
